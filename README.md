## Description
## Project Description

This project is a team-based software development assignment following the Scrum methodology. 
The goal is to deliver a functional application iteratively, with progress tracked through weekly stand-up meetings and formal code-review checkpoints.

In Sprint 1, our focus is on establishing the project workflow, clarifying the project idea, and adopting a Code of Conduct. 
We have set up a GitHub repository with contributions from all team members, created the product backlog and Kanban board, and added the project scaffolding and README file. 

Key deliverables for Sprint 1 include:
- Clear team collaboration through version control on GitHub
- Initial project structure with scaffolding files
- A refined project idea with documented workflows
- Defined Code of Conduct, personas, and ethical considerations
- Meeting records to track weekly progress

This project lays the foundation for subsequent sprints, ensuring all team members can contribute efficiently and the development environment is fully functional.
